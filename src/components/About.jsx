          <h1>A hands on experience on web development and FrontEnd development </h1>
          <p>
            As a fron t end developer, I have experience with mobile and app development.
            Front-end development is simply a process of converting imaginations into high-end graphics and web pages for a great user experience by mixing and matching the essential front-end development tools like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascade Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
